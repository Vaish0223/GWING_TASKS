GWING AI DEVELOPER INTERNSHIP TASKS

- Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python
- Plagiarism Detector Using Machine Learning with Python
- Text Generation AI - Next Word Prediction in Python

TASK 1- Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python
Create a machine learning system that can make a customer segmentation for purchasing behavior. so
you have to use one of the important machine learning algorithms K-Means Clustering with Python.

TASK 2- Plagiarism Detector Using Machine Learning with Python
Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper attribution or permission and presenting it as one’s own. 
It involves copying or closely imitating the content, ideas, or expressions created by others, whether it’s written text, research findings, art, music, software, 
or any other form of creative or intellectual work.

Plagiarism detection is a crucial task in educational and professional settings. By leveraging machine
learning techniques, we can create a robust plagiarism detector that can accurately identify copied
content.
